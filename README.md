# Homework for project attitude demonstration.
## Overview
This project contains larger project that I wrote for homework. I hope to use this to demonstrate my coding practices and my attitude towards coding.

## Description
All codes come from my CSDS 132 course in Case Western. Each of them involve mostly simple technical concepts. 
Even though they are simple, they involve reading detailed and huge instructions for each method, writing mature comments and testing.
It is a good practice for me to write codes in a professional way and collaborate with others.
Thus, I am proud of these codes and I hope to use them to show me as a software developer.
